        "CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole",
        [
            "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book,\u2019 thought Alice \u2018without pictures or conversations?\u2019",
            "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.",
            "There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u2018Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u2019 (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.",
            "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.",
            "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.",
            "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u2018ORANGE MARMALADE\u2019, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.",
            "\u2018Well!\u2019 thought Alice to herself, \u2018after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u2019 (Which was very likely true.)",
            "Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! \u2018I wonder how many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u2019 she said aloud. \u2018I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--\u2019 (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u2018--yes, that\u2019s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u2019 (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)",
            "Presently she began again. \u2018I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--\u2019 (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u2018--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u2019 (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u2018And what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u2019",
            "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \u2018Dinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u2019 (Dinah was the cat.) \u2018I hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u2019 And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u2018Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u2019 and sometimes, \u2018Do bats eat cats?\u2019 for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u2018Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u2019 when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.",
            "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u2018Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u2019 She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.",
            "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.",
            "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",
            "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u2018and even if my head would go through,\u2019 thought poor Alice, \u2018it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u2019 For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.",
            "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, [\u2018which certainly was not here before,\u2019 said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u2018DRINK ME\u2019 beautifully printed on it in large letters.",
            "It was all very well to say \u2018Drink me,\u2019 but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. \u2018No, I\u2019ll look first,\u2019 she said, \u2018and see whether it\u2019s marked \u201cpoison\u201d or not\u2019; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \u2018poison,\u2019 it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.",
            "However, this bottle was NOT marked \u2018poison,\u2019 so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.",
            "\u2018What a curious feeling!\u2019 said Alice; \u2018I must be shutting up like a telescope.\u2019",
            "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u2018for it might end, you know,\u2019 said Alice to herself, \u2018in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u2019 And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.",
            "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.",
            "\u2018Come, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u2019 said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u2018I advise you to leave off this minute!\u2019 She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u2018But it\u2019s no use now,\u2019 thought poor Alice, \u2018to pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!\u2019",
            "Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u2018EAT ME\u2019 were beautifully marked in currants. \u2018Well, I\u2019ll eat it,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u2019",
            "She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u2018Which way? Which way?\u2019, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.",
            "So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake."

            "\u2018Curiouser and curiouser!\u2019 cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u2018now I\u2019m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\u2019 (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). \u2018Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m sure _I_ shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to them,\u2019 thought Alice, \u2018or perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\u2019",
            "And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u2018They must go by the carrier,\u2019 she thought; \u2018and how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending presents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!",
            "ALICE\u2019S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ. HEARTHRUG, NEAR THE FENDER, (WITH ALICE\u2019S LOVE).",
            "Oh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u2019",
            "Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.",
            "Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.",
            "\u2018You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018a great girl like you,\u2019 (she might well say this), \u2018to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\u2019 But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.",
            "After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u2018Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u2019 Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u2018If you please, sir--\u2019 The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.",
            "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u2018Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, THAT\u2019S the great puzzle!\u2019 And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.",
            "\u2018I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u2019 she said, \u2018for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE\u2019S she, and I\u2019m I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I\u2019ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\u2019t signify: let\u2019s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome--no, THAT\u2019S all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u201cHow doth the little--\u201c\u2019 and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--",
            "\u2018How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale!",
            "\u2018How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spread his claws, And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!\u2019",
            "\u2018I\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u2019 said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \u2018I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve made up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here! It\u2019ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \u201cCome up again, dear!\u201d I shall only look up and say \u201cWho am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down here till I\u2019m somebody else\u201d--but, oh dear!\u2019 cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \u2018I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!\u2019",
            "As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while she was talking. \u2018How CAN I have done that?\u2019 she thought. \u2018I must be growing small again.\u2019 She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.",
            "\u2018That WAS a narrow escape!\u2019 said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \u2018and now for the garden!\u2019 and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \u2018and things are worse than ever,\u2019 thought the poor child, \u2018for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u2019",
            "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \u2018and in that case I can go back by railway,\u2019 she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.",
            "\u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u2019 said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. \u2018I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.\u2019",
            "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.",
            "\u2018Would it be of any use, now,\u2019 thought Alice, \u2018to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u2019 So she began: \u2018O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\u2019 (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u2018A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!\u2019) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.",
            "\u2018Perhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u2019 thought Alice; \u2018I daresay it\u2019s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u2019 (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: \u2018Ou est ma chatte?\u2019 which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \u2018Oh, I beg your pardon!\u2019 cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u2018I quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats.\u2019",
            "\u2018Not like cats!\u2019 cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u2018Would YOU like cats if you were me?\u2019",
            "\u2018Well, perhaps not,\u2019 said Alice in a soothing tone: \u2018don\u2019t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,\u2019 Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, \u2018and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!\u2019 cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u2018We won\u2019t talk about her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u2019",
            "\u2018We indeed!\u2019 cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. \u2018As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\u2019t let me hear the name again!\u2019",
            "\u2018I won\u2019t indeed!\u2019 said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. \u2018Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?\u2019 The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \u2018There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\u2019ll fetch things when you throw them, and it\u2019ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I can\u2019t remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it\u2019s so useful, it\u2019s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!\u2019 cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \u2018I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve offended it again!\u2019 For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.",
            "So she called softly after it, \u2018Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u2019 When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u2018Let us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u2019",
            "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore."

            "They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.",
            "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u2018I am older than you, and must know better\u2019; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.",
            "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \u2018Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\u2019LL soon make you dry enough!\u2019 They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.",

            "\u2018I beg your pardon!\u2019 said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \u2018Did you speak?\u2019",
            "\u2018Not I!\u2019 said the Lory hastily.",
            "\u2018I thought you did,\u2019 said the Mouse. \u2018--I proceed. \u201cEdwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--\u201c\u2019",
            "\u2018Found WHAT?\u2019 said the Duck.",
            "\u2018Found IT,\u2019 the Mouse replied rather crossly: \u2018of course you know what \u201cit\u201d means.\u2019",
            "\u2018I know what \u201cit\u201d means well enough, when I find a thing,\u2019 said the Duck: \u2018it\u2019s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\u2019",
            "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \u2018\u201c--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William\u2019s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--\u201d How are you getting on now, my dear?\u2019 it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.",
            "\u2018As wet as ever,\u2019 said Alice in a melancholy tone: \u2018it doesn\u2019t seem to dry me at all.\u2019",
            "\u2018In that case,\u2019 said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \u2018I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\u2019",
            "\u2018Speak English!\u2019 said the Eaglet. \u2018I don\u2019t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t believe you do either!\u2019 And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.",
            "\u2018What I was going to say,\u2019 said the Dodo in an offended tone, \u2018was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\u2019",
            "\u2018What IS a Caucus-race?\u2019 said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.",
            "\u2018Why,\u2019 said the Dodo, \u2018the best way to explain it is to do it.\u2019 (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)",
            "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, [\u2018the exact shape doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \u2018One, two, three, and away,\u2019 but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out \u2018The race is over!\u2019 and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, \u2018But who has won?\u2019",
            "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, \u2018EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.\u2019",
            "\u2018But who is to give the prizes?\u2019 quite a chorus of voices asked.",
            "\u2018Why, SHE, of course,\u2019 said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \u2018Prizes! Prizes!\u2019",
            "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all round.",
            "\u2018But she must have a prize herself, you know,\u2019 said the Mouse.",
            "\u2018Of course,\u2019 the Dodo replied very gravely. \u2018What else have you got in your pocket?\u2019 he went on, turning to Alice.",
            "\u2018Only a thimble,\u2019 said Alice sadly.",
            "\u2018Hand it over here,\u2019 said the Dodo.",
            "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \u2018We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble\u2019; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.",
            "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.",
            "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.",
            "\u2018You promised to tell me your history, you know,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018and why it is you hate--C and D,\u2019 she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.",
            "\u2018Mine is a long and a sad tale!\u2019 said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.",
            "\u2018It IS a long tail, certainly,\u2019 said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u2019s tail; \u2018but why do you call it sad?\u2019 And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:--",
            "\u2018Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, \u201cLet us both go to law: I will prosecute YOU.--Come, I\u2019ll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I\u2019ve nothing to do.\u201d Said the mouse to the cur, \u201cSuch a trial, dear Sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be judge, I\u2019ll be jury,\u201d Said cunning old Fury: \u201cI\u2019ll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.\u201d\u2019",
            "\u2018You are not attending!\u2019 said the Mouse to Alice severely. \u2018What are you thinking of?\u2019",
            "\u2018I beg your pardon,\u2019 said Alice very humbly: \u2018you had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u2019",
            "\u2018I had NOT!\u2019 cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.",
            "\u2018A knot!\u2019 said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. \u2018Oh, do let me help to undo it!\u2019",
            "\u2018I shall do nothing of the sort,\u2019 said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \u2018You insult me by talking such nonsense!\u2019",
            "\u2018I didn\u2019t mean it!\u2019 pleaded poor Alice. \u2018But you\u2019re so easily offended, you know!\u2019",
            "The Mouse only growled in reply.",
            "\u2018Please come back and finish your story!\u2019 Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \u2018Yes, please do!\u2019 but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.",
            "\u2018What a pity it wouldn\u2019t stay!\u2019 sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \u2018Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper!\u2019 \u2018Hold your tongue, Ma!\u2019 said the young Crab, a little snappishly. \u2018You\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u2019",
            "\u2018I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u2019 said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. \u2018She\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u2019",
            "\u2018And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u2019 said the Lory.",
            "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \u2018Dinah\u2019s our cat. And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you can\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u2019",
            "This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \u2018I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u2019 and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \u2018Come away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in bed!\u2019 On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.",
            "\u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u2019 she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u2018Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u2019 And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story."

        "CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill",
        [
            "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \u2018The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?\u2019 Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.",
            "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \u2018Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u2019 And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.",
            "\u2018He took me for his housemaid,\u2019 she said to herself as she ran. \u2018How surprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.\u2019 As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u2018W. RABBIT\u2019 engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.",
            "\u2018How queer it seems,\u2019 Alice said to herself, \u2018to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u2019 And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u2018\u201cMiss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u201d \u201cComing in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u201d Only I don\u2019t think,\u2019 Alice went on, \u2018that they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u2019",
            "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words \u2018DRINK ME,\u2019 but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \u2018I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,\u2019 she said to herself, \u2018whenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u2019",
            "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \u2018That\u2019s quite enough--I hope I shan\u2019t grow any more--As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the door--I do wish I hadn\u2019t drunk quite so much!\u2019",
            "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \u2018Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?\u2019",
            "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.",
            "\u2018It was much pleasanter at home,\u2019 thought poor Alice, \u2018when one wasn\u2019t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I\u2019ll write one--but I\u2019m grown up now,\u2019 she added in a sorrowful tone; \u2018at least there\u2019s no room to grow up any more HERE.\u2019",
            "\u2018But then,\u2019 thought Alice, \u2018shall I NEVER get any older than I am now? That\u2019ll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\u2019t like THAT!\u2019",
            "\u2018Oh, you foolish Alice!\u2019 she answered herself. \u2018How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there\u2019s hardly room for YOU, and no room at all for any lesson-books!\u2019",
            "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.",
            "\u2018Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\u2019 said the voice. \u2018Fetch me my gloves this moment!\u2019 Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.",
            "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice\u2019s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \u2018Then I\u2019ll go round and get in at the window.\u2019",
            "\u2018THAT you won\u2019t\u2019 thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.",
            "Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit\u2019s--\u2018Pat! Pat! Where are you?\u2019 And then a voice she had never heard before, \u2018Sure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u2019",
            "\u2018Digging for apples, indeed!\u2019 said the Rabbit angrily. \u2018Here! Come and help me out of THIS!\u2019 (Sounds of more broken glass.)",
            "\u2018Now tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u2019",
            "\u2018Sure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u2019 (He pronounced it \u2018arrum.\u2019)",
            "\u2018An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\u2019",
            "\u2018Sure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u2019",
            "\u2018Well, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u2019",
            "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \u2018Sure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\u2019 \u2018Do as I tell you, you coward!\u2019 and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u2018What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!\u2019 thought Alice. \u2018I wonder what they\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u2019",
            "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \u2018Where\u2019s the other ladder?--Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put \u2018em up at this corner--No, tie \u2018em together first--they don\u2019t reach half high enough yet--Oh! they\u2019ll do well enough; don\u2019t be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it\u2019s coming down! Heads below!\u2019 (a loud crash)--\u2018Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who\u2019s to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan\u2019t! YOU do it!--That I won\u2019t, then!--Bill\u2019s to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you\u2019re to go down the chimney!\u2019",
            "\u2018Oh! So Bill\u2019s got to come down the chimney, has he?\u2019 said Alice to herself. \u2018Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\u2019t be in Bill\u2019s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!\u2019",
            "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn\u2019t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself \u2018This is Bill,\u2019 she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.",
            "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of \u2018There goes Bill!\u2019 then the Rabbit\u2019s voice along--\u2018Catch him, you by the hedge!\u2019 then silence, and then another confusion of voices--\u2018Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don\u2019t choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!\u2019",
            "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, [\u2018That\u2019s Bill,\u2019 thought Alice,) \u2018Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I\u2019m better now--but I\u2019m a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\u2019",
            "\u2018So you did, old fellow!\u2019 said the others.",
            "\u2018We must burn the house down!\u2019 said the Rabbit\u2019s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, \u2018If you do. I\u2019ll set Dinah at you!\u2019",
            "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \u2018I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they\u2019d take the roof off.\u2019 After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \u2018A barrowful will do, to begin with.\u2019",
            "\u2018A barrowful of WHAT?\u2019 thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. \u2018I\u2019ll put a stop to this,\u2019 she said to herself, and shouted out, \u2018You\u2019d better not do that again!\u2019 which produced another dead silence.",
            "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. \u2018If I eat one of these cakes,\u2019 she thought, \u2018it\u2019s sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it can\u2019t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.\u2019",
            "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.",
            "\u2018The first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u2019 said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \u2018is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.\u2019",
            "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.",
            "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u2018Poor little thing!\u2019 said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.",
            "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.",
            "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.",
            "\u2018And yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u2019 said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: \u2018I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I\u2019d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\u2019d nearly forgotten that I\u2019ve got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?\u2019",
            "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.",
            "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else."

            "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u2018I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.\u2019",
            "\u2018Why?\u2019 said the Caterpillar.",

            "\u2018In my youth,\u2019 Father William replied to his son, \u2018I feared it might injure the brain; But, now that I\u2019m perfectly sure I have none, Why, I do it again and again.\u2019",
            "\u2018You are old,\u2019 said the youth, \u2018as I mentioned before, And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door-- Pray, what is the reason of that?\u2019",
            "\u2018In my youth,\u2019 said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, \u2018I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box-- Allow me to sell you a couple?\u2019",
            "\u2018You are old,\u2019 said the youth, \u2018and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak-- Pray how did you manage to do it?\u2019",
            "\u2018In my youth,\u2019 said his father, \u2018I took to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, Has lasted the rest of my life.\u2019",

            "\u2018It is a very good height indeed!\u2019 said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).",
            "\u2018But I\u2019m not used to it!\u2019 pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, \u2018I wish the creatures wouldn\u2019t be so easily offended!\u2019",
            "\u2018You\u2019ll get used to it in time,\u2019 said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.",
            "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, \u2018One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\u2019",
            "\u2018One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?\u2019 thought Alice to herself.",
            "\u2018Of the mushroom,\u2019 said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.",
            "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.",
            "\u2018And now which is which?\u2019 she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!",
            "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.",
            "\u2018Come, my head\u2019s free at last!\u2019 said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.",
            "\u2018What CAN all that green stuff be?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018And where HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\u2019t see you?\u2019 She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",
            "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.",
            "\u2018Serpent!\u2019 screamed the Pigeon.",
            "\u2018I\u2019m NOT a serpent!\u2019 said Alice indignantly. \u2018Let me alone!\u2019",
            "\u2018Serpent, I say again!\u2019 repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, \u2018I\u2019ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!\u2019",
            "\u2018I haven\u2019t the least idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018I\u2019ve tried the roots of trees, and I\u2019ve tried banks, and I\u2019ve tried hedges,\u2019 the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \u2018but those serpents! There\u2019s no pleasing them!\u2019",
            "Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.",
            "\u2018As if it wasn\u2019t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\u2019 said the Pigeon; \u2018but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven\u2019t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\u2019",
            "\u2018I\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve been annoyed,\u2019 said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.",
            "\u2018And just as I\u2019d taken the highest tree in the wood,\u2019 continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \u2018and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\u2019",
            "\u2018But I\u2019m NOT a serpent, I tell you!\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I\u2019m a--I\u2019m a--\u2019",
            "\u2018Well! WHAT are you?\u2019 said the Pigeon. \u2018I can see you\u2019re trying to invent something!\u2019",
            "\u2018I--I\u2019m a little girl,\u2019 said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.",
            "\u2018A likely story indeed!\u2019 said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. \u2018I\u2019ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You\u2019re a serpent; and there\u2019s no use denying it. I suppose you\u2019ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!\u2019",
            "\u2018I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,\u2019 said Alice, who was a very truthful child; \u2018but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.\u2019",
            "\u2018I don\u2019t believe it,\u2019 said the Pigeon; \u2018but if they do, why then they\u2019re a kind of serpent, that\u2019s all I can say.\u2019",
            "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \u2018You\u2019re looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you\u2019re a little girl or a serpent?\u2019",
            "\u2018It matters a good deal to ME,\u2019 said Alice hastily; \u2018but I\u2019m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\u2019t want YOURS: I don\u2019t like them raw.\u2019",
            "\u2018Well, be off, then!\u2019 said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.",
            "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. \u2018Come, there\u2019s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\u2019m never sure what I\u2019m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I\u2019ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done, I wonder?\u2019 As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \u2018Whoever lives there,\u2019 thought Alice, \u2018it\u2019ll never do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\u2019 So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high."

            "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.",
            "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \u2018For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\u2019 The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, \u2018From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\u2019",
            "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.",

First, because I\u2019m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they\u2019re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.\u2019 And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.",
            "\u2018Please, then,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018how am I to get in?\u2019",
            "\u2018There might be some sense in your knocking,\u2019 the Footman went on without attending to her, \u2018if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.\u2019 He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \u2018But perhaps he can\u2019t help it,\u2019 she said to herself; \u2018his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?\u2019 she repeated, aloud.",

The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.",
            "\u2018Please would you tell me,\u2019 said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \u2018why your cat grins like that?\u2019",
            "\u2018It\u2019s a Cheshire cat,\u2019 said the Duchess, \u2018and that\u2019s why. Pig!\u2019",

While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.",
            "\u2018Oh, PLEASE mind what you\u2019re doing!\u2019 cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. \u2018Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose\u2019; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.",
            "\u2018If everybody minded their own business,\u2019 the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, \u2018the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\u2019",
            "\u2018Which would NOT be an advantage,\u2019 said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \u2018Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--\u2019",
            "\u2018Talking of axes,\u2019 said the Duchess, \u2018chop off her head!\u2019",
            "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: \u2018Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--\u2019",
            "\u2018Oh, don\u2019t bother ME,\u2019 said the Duchess; \u2018I never could abide figures!\u2019 And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:",
            "\u2018Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases.\u2019",

            "\u2018Wow! wow! wow!\u2019",
            "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--",
            "\u2018I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!\u2019",
            "CHORUS.",

            "\u2018Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\u2019 the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \u2018I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\u2019 and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.",
            "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, \u2018just like a star-fish,\u2019 thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",
            "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. \u2018IF I don\u2019t take this child away with me,\u2019 thought Alice, \u2018they\u2019re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\u2019t it be murder to leave it behind?\u2019 She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). \u2018Don\u2019t grunt,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018that\u2019s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.\u2019",
            "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. \u2018But perhaps it was only sobbing,\u2019 she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.",
            "No, there were no tears. \u2018If you\u2019re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\u2019 said Alice, seriously, \u2018I\u2019ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!\u2019 The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.",
            "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \u2018Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?\u2019 when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.",
            "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. \u2018If it had grown up,\u2019 she said to herself, \u2018it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.\u2019 And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, \u2018if one only knew the right way to change them--\u2019 when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.",
            "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.",
            "\u2018Cheshire Puss,\u2019 she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. \u2018Come, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u2019 thought Alice, and she went on. \u2018Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u2019",
            "\u2018That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u2019 said the Cat.",
            "\u2018I don\u2019t much care where--\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Then it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u2019 said the Cat.",
            "\u2018--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,\u2019 Alice added as an explanation.",
            "\u2018Oh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018if you only walk long enough.\u2019",
            "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. \u2018What sort of people live about here?\u2019",
            "\u2018In THAT direction,\u2019 the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u2018lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,\u2019 waving the other paw, \u2018lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u2019",
            "\u2018But I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u2019 Alice remarked.",
            "\u2018Oh, you can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said the Cat: \u2018we\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u2019",
            "\u2018How do you know I\u2019m mad?\u2019 said Alice.",

            "Alice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u2018And how do you know that you\u2019re mad?\u2019",
            "\u2018To begin with,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018a dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u2019",
            "\u2018I suppose so,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Well, then,\u2019 the Cat went on, \u2018you see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now I growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u2019",
            "\u2018I call it purring, not growling,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Call it what you like,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\u2019",
            "\u2018I should like it very much,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018but I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u2019",
            "\u2018You\u2019ll see me there,\u2019 said the Cat, and vanished.",
            "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.",
            "\u2018By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018I\u2019d nearly forgotten to ask.\u2019",
            "\u2018It turned into a pig,\u2019 Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.",
            "\u2018I thought it would,\u2019 said the Cat, and vanished again.",
            "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. \u2018I\u2019ve seen hatters before,\u2019 she said to herself; \u2018the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won\u2019t be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.\u2019 As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.",
            "\u2018Did you say pig, or fig?\u2019 said the Cat.",
            "\u2018I said pig,\u2019 replied Alice; \u2018and I wish you wouldn\u2019t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\u2019",
            "\u2018All right,\u2019 said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.",
            "\u2018Well! I\u2019ve often seen a cat without a grin,\u2019 thought Alice; \u2018but a grin without a cat! It\u2019s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\u2019",
            "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself \u2018Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u2019"

        [
            "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \u2018Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u2019 thought Alice; \u2018only, as it\u2019s asleep, I suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u2019",
            "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \u2018No room! No room!\u2019 they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \u2018There\u2019s PLENTY of room!\u2019 said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.",
            "\u2018Have some wine,\u2019 the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.",
            "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. \u2018I don\u2019t see any wine,\u2019 she remarked.",
            "\u2018There isn\u2019t any,\u2019 said the March Hare.",
            "\u2018Then it wasn\u2019t very civil of you to offer it,\u2019 said Alice angrily.",
            "\u2018It wasn\u2019t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\u2019 said the March Hare.",
            "\u2018I didn\u2019t know it was YOUR table,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018it\u2019s laid for a great many more than three.\u2019",
            "\u2018Your hair wants cutting,\u2019 said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.",
            "\u2018You should learn not to make personal remarks,\u2019 Alice said with some severity; \u2018it\u2019s very rude.\u2019",
            "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID was, \u2018Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\u2019",
            "\u2018Come, we shall have some fun now!\u2019 thought Alice. \u2018I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,\u2019 she added aloud.",
            "\u2018Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\u2019 said the March Hare.",
            "\u2018Exactly so,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Then you should say what you mean,\u2019 the March Hare went on.",
            "\u2018I do,\u2019 Alice hastily replied; \u2018at least--at least I mean what I say--that\u2019s the same thing, you know.\u2019",
            "\u2018Not the same thing a bit!\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018You might just as well say that \u201cI see what I eat\u201d is the same thing as \u201cI eat what I see\u201d!\u2019",
            "\u2018You might just as well say,\u2019 added the March Hare, \u2018that \u201cI like what I get\u201d is the same thing as \u201cI get what I like\u201d!\u2019",
            "\u2018You might just as well say,\u2019 added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, \u2018that \u201cI breathe when I sleep\u201d is the same thing as \u201cI sleep when I breathe\u201d!\u2019",
            "\u2018It IS the same thing with you,\u2019 said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn\u2019t much.",
            "The Hatter was the first to break the silence. \u2018What day of the month is it?\u2019 he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.",
            "Alice considered a little, and then said \u2018The fourth.\u2019",
            "\u2018Two days wrong!\u2019 sighed the Hatter. \u2018I told you butter wouldn\u2019t suit the works!\u2019 he added looking angrily at the March Hare.",
            "\u2018It was the BEST butter,\u2019 the March Hare meekly replied.",
            "\u2018Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\u2019 the Hatter grumbled: \u2018you shouldn\u2019t have put it in with the bread-knife.\u2019",
            "The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, \u2018It was the BEST butter, you know.\u2019",
            "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \u2018What a funny watch!\u2019 she remarked. \u2018It tells the day of the month, and doesn\u2019t tell what o\u2019clock it is!\u2019",
            "\u2018Why should it?\u2019 muttered the Hatter. \u2018Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?\u2019",

            "\u2018If you knew Time as well as I do,\u2019 said the Hatter, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t talk about wasting IT. It\u2019s HIM.\u2019",

            "\u2018Ah! that accounts for it,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018He won\u2019t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\u2019d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\u2019clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you\u2019d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!\u2019",

            "The Hatter shook his head mournfully. \u2018Not I!\u2019 he replied. \u2018We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--\u2019 (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \u2018--it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing",

            "\u2018It goes on, you know,\u2019 the Hatter continued, \u2018in this way:--",
            "\u201cUp above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle--\u201c\u2019",
            "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep \u2018Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--\u2019 and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.",
            "\u2018Well, I\u2019d hardly finished the first verse,\u2019 said the Hatter, \u2018when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \u201cHe\u2019s murdering the time! Off with his head!\u201d\u2019",
            "\u2018How dreadfully savage!\u2019 exclaimed Alice.",
            "\u2018And ever since that,\u2019 the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \u2018he won\u2019t do a thing I ask! It\u2019s always six o\u2019clock now.\u2019",
            "A bright idea came into Alice\u2019s head. \u2018Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?\u2019 she asked.",
            "\u2018Yes, that\u2019s it,\u2019 said the Hatter with a sigh: \u2018it\u2019s always tea-time, and we\u2019ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\u2019",
            "\u2018Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\u2019 said Alice.",

            "\u2018Nobody asked YOUR opinion,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Who\u2019s making personal remarks now?\u2019 the Hatter asked triumphantly.",
            "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. \u2018Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u2019",
            "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, \u2018It was a treacle-well.\u2019",
            "\u2018There\u2019s no such thing!\u2019 Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went \u2018Sh! sh!\u2019 and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, \u2018If you can\u2019t be civil, you\u2019d better finish the story for yourself.\u2019",
            "\u2018No, please go on!\u2019 Alice said very humbly; \u2018I won\u2019t interrupt again. I dare say there may be ONE.\u2019",
            "\u2018One, indeed!\u2019 said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. \u2018And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you know--\u2019",
            "\u2018What did they draw?\u2019 said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.",

            "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse\u2019s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.",
            "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: \u2018But I don\u2019t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?\u2019",
            "\u2018You can draw water out of a water-well,\u2019 said the Hatter; \u2018so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?\u2019",
            "\u2018But they were IN the well,\u2019 Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.",

            "This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.",
            "\u2018They were learning to draw,\u2019 the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \u2018and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--\u2019",

            "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: \u2018--that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say things are \u201cmuch of a muchness\u201d--did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?\u2019",
            "\u2018Really, now you ask me,\u2019 said Alice, very much confused, \u2018I don\u2019t think--\u2019",
            "\u2018Then you shouldn\u2019t talk,\u2019 said the Hatter.",
            "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.",
            "\u2018At any rate I\u2019ll never go THERE again!\u2019 said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. \u2018It\u2019s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!\u2019",
            "Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. \u2018That\u2019s very curious!\u2019 she thought. \u2018But everything\u2019s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\u2019 And in she went.",
            "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. \u2018Now, I\u2019ll manage better this time,\u2019 she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains."

Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, \u2018Look out now, Five! Don\u2019t go splashing paint over me like that!\u2019",

            "Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun \u2018Well, of all the unjust things--\u2019 when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.",
            "\u2018Would you tell me,\u2019 said Alice, a little timidly, \u2018why you are painting those roses?\u2019",
            "Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, \u2018Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we\u2019re doing our best, afore she comes, to--\u2019 At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \u2018The Queen! The Queen!\u2019 and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",
            "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.",
            "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; \u2018and besides, what would be the use of a procession,\u2019 thought she, \u2018if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u2019 So she stood still where she was, and waited.",
            "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely \u2018Who is this?\u2019 She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.",
            "\u2018Idiot!\u2019 said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, \u2018What\u2019s your name, child?\u2019",
            "\u2018My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\u2019 said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, \u2018Why, they\u2019re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn\u2019t be afraid of them!\u2019",
            "\u2018And who are THESE?\u2019 said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.",
            "\u2018How should I know?\u2019 said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \u2018It\u2019s no business of MINE.\u2019",

            "\u2018May it please your Majesty,\u2019 said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, \u2018we were trying--\u2019",

            "\u2018You shan\u2019t be beheaded!\u2019 said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.",

            "\u2018Get to your places!\u2019 shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",
            "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.",
            "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting \u2018Off with his head!\u2019 or \u2018Off with her head!\u2019 about once in a minute.",
            "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, \u2018and then,\u2019 thought she, \u2018what would become of me? They\u2019re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\u2019s any one left alive!\u2019",
            "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself \u2018It\u2019s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.\u2019",
            "\u2018How are you getting on?\u2019 said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.",
            "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \u2018It\u2019s no use speaking to it,\u2019 she thought, \u2018till its ears have come, or at least one of them.\u2019 In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",
            "\u2018I don\u2019t think they play at all fairly,\u2019 Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, \u2018and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\u2019t hear oneself speak--and they don\u2019t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you\u2019ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\u2019s the arch I\u2019ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen\u2019s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!\u2019",
            "\u2018How do you like the Queen?\u2019 said the Cat in a low voice.",
            "\u2018Not at all,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018she\u2019s so extremely--\u2019 Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \u2018--likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u2019",
            "The Queen smiled and passed on.",

            "\u2018A cat may look at a king,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I\u2019ve read that in some book, but I don\u2019t remember where.\u2019",
            "\u2018Well, it must be removed,\u2019 said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u2018My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!\u2019",
            "The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. \u2018Off with his head!\u2019 she said, without even looking round.",

            "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen\u2019s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.",
            "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",
            "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \u2018but it doesn\u2019t matter much,\u2019 thought Alice, \u2018as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.\u2019 So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.",
            "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.",
            "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.",
            "The executioner\u2019s argument was, that you couldn\u2019t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn\u2019t going to begin at HIS time of life.",
            "The King\u2019s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren\u2019t to talk nonsense.",
            "The Queen\u2019s argument was, that if something wasn\u2019t done about it in less than no time she\u2019d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)",
            "Alice could think of nothing else to say but \u2018It belongs to the Duchess: you\u2019d better ask HER about it.\u2019",
            "\u2018She\u2019s in prison,\u2019 the Queen said to the executioner: \u2018fetch her here.\u2019 And the executioner went off like an arrow.",
            "The Cat\u2019s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game."

Soup does very well without--Maybe it\u2019s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,\u2019 she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, \u2018and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn\u2019t be so stingy about it, you know--\u2019",
            "She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \u2018You\u2019re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can\u2019t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.\u2019",
            "\u2018Perhaps it hasn\u2019t one,\u2019 Alice ventured to remark.",
            "\u2018Tut, tut, child!\u2019 said the Duchess. \u2018Everything\u2019s got a moral, if only you can find it.\u2019 And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\u2019s side as she spoke.",
            "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice\u2019s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.",
            "\u2018The game\u2019s going on rather better now,\u2019 she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.",
            "\u2018\u2019Tis so,\u2019 said the Duchess: \u2018and the moral of that is--\u201cOh, \u2018tis love, \u2018tis love, that makes the world go round!\u201d\u2019",
            "\u2018Somebody said,\u2019 Alice whispered, \u2018that it\u2019s done by everybody minding their own business!\u2019",
            "\u2018Ah, well! It means much the same thing,\u2019 said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice\u2019s shoulder as she added, \u2018and the moral of THAT is--\u201cTake care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.\u201d\u2019",
            "\u2018How fond she is of finding morals in things!\u2019 Alice thought to herself.",
            "\u2018I dare say you\u2019re wondering why I don\u2019t put my arm round your waist,\u2019 the Duchess said after a pause: \u2018the reason is, that I\u2019m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\u2019",
            "\u2018HE might bite,\u2019 Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.",
            "\u2018Very true,\u2019 said the Duchess: \u2018flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is--\u201cBirds of a feather flock together.\u201d\u2019",
            "\u2018Only mustard isn\u2019t a bird,\u2019 Alice remarked.",
            "\u2018Right, as usual,\u2019 said the Duchess: \u2018what a clear way you have of putting things!\u2019",
            "\u2018It\u2019s a mineral, I THINK,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Of course it is,\u2019 said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; \u2018there\u2019s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is--\u201cThe more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.\u201d\u2019",
            "\u2018Oh, I know!\u2019 exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, \u2018it\u2019s a vegetable. It doesn\u2019t look like one, but it is.\u2019",
            "\u2018I quite agree with you,\u2019 said the Duchess; \u2018and the moral of that is--\u201cBe what you would seem to be\u201d--or if you\u2019d like it put more simply--\u201cNever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\u201d\u2019",
            "\u2018I think I should understand that better,\u2019 Alice said very politely, \u2018if I had it written down: but I can\u2019t quite follow it as you say it.\u2019",
            "\u2018That\u2019s nothing to what I could say if I chose,\u2019 the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.",
            "\u2018Pray don\u2019t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Oh, don\u2019t talk about trouble!\u2019 said the Duchess. \u2018I make you a present of everything I\u2019ve said as yet.\u2019",
            "\u2018A cheap sort of present!\u2019 thought Alice. \u2018I\u2019m glad they don\u2019t give birthday presents like that!\u2019 But she did not venture to say it out loud.",
            "\u2018Thinking again?\u2019 the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.",
            "\u2018I\u2019ve a right to think,\u2019 said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.",
            "\u2018Just about as much right,\u2019 said the Duchess, \u2018as pigs have to fly; and the m--\u2019",
            "But here, to Alice\u2019s great surprise, the Duchess\u2019s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word \u2018moral,\u2019 and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.",
            "\u2018A fine day, your Majesty!\u2019 the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.",
            "\u2018Now, I give you fair warning,\u2019 shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; \u2018either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!\u2019",
            "The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.",
            "\u2018Let\u2019s go on with the game,\u2019 the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.",
            "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\u2019s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\u2019s delay would cost them their lives.",
            "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting \u2018Off with his head!\u2019 or \u2018Off with her head!\u2019 Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.",
            "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \u2018Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\u2019",
            "\u2018No,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I don\u2019t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\u2019",
            "\u2018It\u2019s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\u2019 said the Queen.",
            "\u2018I never saw one, or heard of one,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Come on, then,\u2019 said the Queen, \u2018and he shall tell you his history,\u2019",
            "As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, \u2018You are all pardoned.\u2019 \u2018Come, THAT\u2019S a good thing!\u2019 she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.",
            "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (IF you don\u2019t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \u2018Up, lazy thing!\u2019 said the Queen, \u2018and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered\u2019; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.",
            "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. \u2018What fun!\u2019 said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.",
            "\u2018What IS the fun?\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Why, SHE,\u2019 said the Gryphon. \u2018It\u2019s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!\u2019",
            "\u2018Everybody says \u201ccome on!\u201d here,\u2019 thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: \u2018I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\u2019",
            "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. \u2018What is his sorrow?\u2019 she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \u2018It\u2019s all his fancy, that: he hasn\u2019t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\u2019",
            "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.",
            "\u2018This here young lady,\u2019 said the Gryphon, \u2018she wants for to know your history, she do.\u2019",
            "\u2018I\u2019ll tell it her,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \u2018sit down, both of you, and don\u2019t speak a word till I\u2019ve finished.\u2019",
            "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, \u2018I don\u2019t see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn\u2019t begin.\u2019 But she waited patiently.",
            "\u2018Once,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \u2018I was a real Turtle.\u2019",
            "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of \u2018Hjckrrh!\u2019 from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, \u2018Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,\u2019 but she could not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.",
            "\u2018When we were little,\u2019 the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, \u2018we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--\u2019",
            "\u2018Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\u2019t one?\u2019 Alice asked.",
            "\u2018We called him Tortoise because he taught us,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle angrily: \u2018really you are very dull!\u2019",
            "\u2018You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,\u2019 added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \u2018Drive on, old fellow! Don\u2019t be all day about it!\u2019 and he went on in these words:",
            "\u2018Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn\u2019t believe it--\u2019",
            "\u2018I never said I didn\u2019t!\u2019 interrupted Alice.",
            "\u2018You did,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle.",
            "\u2018Hold your tongue!\u2019 added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on.",
            "\u2018We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--\u2019",
            "\u2018I\u2019VE been to a day-school, too,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018you needn\u2019t be so proud as all that.\u2019",
            "\u2018With extras?\u2019 asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.",
            "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018we learned French and music.\u2019",
            "\u2018And washing?\u2019 said the Mock Turtle.",
            "\u2018Certainly not!\u2019 said Alice indignantly.",
            "\u2018Ah! then yours wasn\u2019t a really good school,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. \u2018Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill, \u201cFrench, music, AND WASHING--extra.\u201d\u2019",
            "\u2018You couldn\u2019t have wanted it much,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018living at the bottom of the sea.\u2019",
            "\u2018I couldn\u2019t afford to learn it.\u2019 said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \u2018I only took the regular course.\u2019",

            "\u2018Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\u2019 the Mock Turtle replied; \u2018and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.\u2019",
            "\u2018I never heard of \u201cUglification,\u201d\u2019 Alice ventured to say. \u2018What is it?\u2019",
            "The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \u2018What! Never heard of uglifying!\u2019 it exclaimed. \u2018You know what to beautify is, I suppose?\u2019",
            "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Alice doubtfully: \u2018it means--to--make--anything--prettier.\u2019",
            "\u2018Well, then,\u2019 the Gryphon went on, \u2018if you don\u2019t know what to uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.\u2019",
            "Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said \u2018What else had you to learn?\u2019",
            "\u2018Well, there was Mystery,\u2019 the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, \u2018--Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.\u2019",

            "\u2018Hadn\u2019t time,\u2019 said the Gryphon: \u2018I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.\u2019",

            "\u2018Ten hours the first day,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle: \u2018nine the next, and so on.\u2019",

            "\u2018That\u2019s the reason they\u2019re called lessons,\u2019 the Gryphon remarked: \u2018because they lessen from day to day.\u2019",

He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. \u2018Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\u2019 said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:--",

            "\u2018I don\u2019t know where Dinn may be,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle, \u2018but if you\u2019ve seen them so often, of course you know what they\u2019re like.\u2019",
            "\u2018I believe so,\u2019 Alice replied thoughtfully. \u2018They have their tails in their mouths--and they\u2019re all over crumbs.\u2019",
            "\u2018You\u2019re wrong about the crumbs,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle: \u2018crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the reason is--\u2019 here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--\u2018Tell her about the reason and all that,\u2019 he said to the Gryphon.",
            "\u2018The reason is,\u2019 said the Gryphon, \u2018that they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn\u2019t get them out again. That\u2019s all.\u2019",
            "\u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018it\u2019s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.\u2019",
            "\u2018I can tell you more than that, if you like,\u2019 said the Gryphon. \u2018Do you know why it\u2019s called a whiting?\u2019",
            "\u2018I never thought about it,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Why?\u2019",
            "\u2018IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.\u2019 the Gryphon replied very solemnly.",
            "Alice was thoroughly puzzled. \u2018Does the boots and shoes!\u2019 she repeated in a wondering tone.",
            "\u2018Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?\u2019 said the Gryphon. \u2018I mean, what makes them so shiny?\u2019",
            "Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. \u2018They\u2019re done with blacking, I believe.\u2019",
            "\u2018Boots and shoes under the sea,\u2019 the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, \u2018are done with a whiting. Now you know.\u2019",
            "\u2018And what are they made of?\u2019 Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.",
            "\u2018Soles and eels, of course,\u2019 the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: \u2018any shrimp could have told you that.\u2019",
            "\u2018If I\u2019d been the whiting,\u2019 said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, \u2018I\u2019d have said to the porpoise, \u201cKeep back, please: we don\u2019t want YOU with us!\u201d\u2019",
            "\u2018They were obliged to have him with them,\u2019 the Mock Turtle said: \u2018no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\u2019",
            "\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it really?\u2019 said Alice in a tone of great surprise.",
            "\u2018Of course not,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle: \u2018why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \u201cWith what porpoise?\u201d\u2019",
            "\u2018Don\u2019t you mean \u201cpurpose\u201d?\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018I mean what I say,\u2019 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added \u2018Come, let\u2019s hear some of YOUR adventures.\u2019",
            "\u2018I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,\u2019 said Alice a little timidly: \u2018but it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\u2019",
            "\u2018Explain all that,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle.",
            "\u2018No, no! The adventures first,\u2019 said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \u2018explanations take such a dreadful time.\u2019",
            "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating \u2018YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\u2019 to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said \u2018That\u2019s very curious.\u2019",
            "\u2018It\u2019s all about as curious as it can be,\u2019 said the Gryphon.",
            "\u2018It all came different!\u2019 the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \u2018I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.\u2019 He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.",
            "\u2018Stand up and repeat \u201c\u2018TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,\u201d\u2019 said the Gryphon.",
            "\u2018How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\u2019 thought Alice; \u2018I might as well be at school at once.\u2019 However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--",
            "\u2018\u2019Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, \u201cYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\u201d As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\u2019",
            "[later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark, But, when the tide rises and sharks are around, His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]",
            "\u2018That\u2019s different from what I used to say when I was a child,\u2019 said the Gryphon.",
            "\u2018Well, I never heard it before,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle; \u2018but it sounds uncommon nonsense.\u2019",
            "Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.",
            "\u2018I should like to have it explained,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle.",
            "\u2018She can\u2019t explain it,\u2019 said the Gryphon hastily. \u2018Go on with the next verse.\u2019",
            "\u2018But about his toes?\u2019 the Mock Turtle persisted. \u2018How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?\u2019",
            "\u2018It\u2019s the first position in dancing.\u2019 Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.",
            "\u2018Go on with the next verse,\u2019 the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \u2018it begins \u201cI passed by his garden.\u201d\u2019",
            "Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--",
            "\u2018I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--\u2019",
            "[later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat. When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, And concluded the banquet--]",
            "\u2018What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,\u2019 the Mock Turtle interrupted, \u2018if you don\u2019t explain it as you go on? It\u2019s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!\u2019",
            "\u2018Yes, I think you\u2019d better leave off,\u2019 said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.",
            "\u2018Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\u2019 the Gryphon went on. \u2018Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\u2019",
            "\u2018Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\u2019 Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, \u2018Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \u201cTurtle Soup,\u201d will you, old fellow?\u2019",
            "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:--",
            "\u2018Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen! Who for such dainties would not stoop? Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!",

            "\u2018Chorus again!\u2019 cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of \u2018The trial\u2019s beginning!\u2019 was heard in the distance.",
            "\u2018Come on!\u2019 cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.",
            "\u2018What trial is it?\u2019 Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered \u2018Come on!\u2019 and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--",

        "CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?",
        [
            "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--\u2018I wish they\u2019d get the trial done,\u2019 she thought, \u2018and hand round the refreshments!\u2019 But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.",
            "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. \u2018That\u2019s the judge,\u2019 she said to herself, \u2018because of his great wig.\u2019",
            "The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.",
            "\u2018And that\u2019s the jury-box,\u2019 thought Alice, \u2018and those twelve creatures,\u2019 (she was obliged to say \u2018creatures,\u2019 you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) \u2018I suppose they are the jurors.\u2019 She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, \u2018jury-men\u2019 would have done just as well.",
            "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \u2018What are they doing?\u2019 Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \u2018They can\u2019t have anything to put down yet, before the trial\u2019s begun.\u2019",
            "\u2018They\u2019re putting down their names,\u2019 the Gryphon whispered in reply, \u2018for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\u2019",
            "\u2018Stupid things!\u2019 Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \u2018Silence in the court!\u2019 and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.",
            "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down \u2018stupid things!\u2019 on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn\u2019t know how to spell \u2018stupid,\u2019 and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \u2018A nice muddle their slates\u2019ll be in before the trial\u2019s over!\u2019 thought Alice.",
            "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.",
            "\u2018Herald, read the accusation!\u2019 said the King.",
            "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--",
            "\u2018The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!\u2019",
            "\u2018Consider your verdict,\u2019 the King said to the jury.",
            "\u2018Not yet, not yet!\u2019 the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \u2018There\u2019s a great deal to come before that!\u2019",
            "\u2018Call the first witness,\u2019 said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \u2018First witness!\u2019",
            "The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. \u2018I beg pardon, your Majesty,\u2019 he began, \u2018for bringing these in: but I hadn\u2019t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.\u2019",
            "\u2018You ought to have finished,\u2019 said the King. \u2018When did you begin?\u2019",
            "The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. \u2018Fourteenth of March, I think it was,\u2019 he said.",
            "\u2018Fifteenth,\u2019 said the March Hare.",
            "\u2018Sixteenth,\u2019 added the Dormouse.",
            "\u2018Write that down,\u2019 the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.",
            "\u2018Take off your hat,\u2019 the King said to the Hatter.",
            "\u2018It isn\u2019t mine,\u2019 said the Hatter.",
            "\u2018Stolen!\u2019 the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.",
            "\u2018I keep them to sell,\u2019 the Hatter added as an explanation; \u2018I\u2019ve none of my own. I\u2019m a hatter.\u2019",
            "Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.",
            "\u2018Give your evidence,\u2019 said the King; \u2018and don\u2019t be nervous, or I\u2019ll have you executed on the spot.\u2019",
            "This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.",
            "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.",
            "\u2018I wish you wouldn\u2019t squeeze so.\u2019 said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. \u2018I can hardly breathe.\u2019",
            "\u2018I can\u2019t help it,\u2019 said Alice very meekly: \u2018I\u2019m growing.\u2019",
            "\u2018You\u2019ve no right to grow here,\u2019 said the Dormouse.",
            "\u2018Don\u2019t talk nonsense,\u2019 said Alice more boldly: \u2018you know you\u2019re growing too.\u2019",
            "\u2018Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,\u2019 said the Dormouse: \u2018not in that ridiculous fashion.\u2019 And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.",
            "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, \u2018Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\u2019 on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.",
            "\u2018Give your evidence,\u2019 the King repeated angrily, \u2018or I\u2019ll have you executed, whether you\u2019re nervous or not.\u2019",

            "\u2018The twinkling of the what?\u2019 said the King.",

            "\u2018I\u2019m a poor man,\u2019 the Hatter went on, \u2018and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--\u2019",
            "\u2018I didn\u2019t!\u2019 the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.",
            "\u2018You did!\u2019 said the Hatter.",

            "\u2018Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--\u2019 the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.",
            "\u2018After that,\u2019 continued the Hatter, \u2018I cut some more bread-and-butter--\u2019",
            "\u2018But what did the Dormouse say?\u2019 one of the jury asked.",
            "\u2018That I can\u2019t remember,\u2019 said the Hatter.",
            "\u2018You MUST remember,\u2019 remarked the King, \u2018or I\u2019ll have you executed.\u2019",
            "The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. \u2018I\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u2019 he began.",
            "\u2018You\u2019re a very poor speaker,\u2019 said the King.",
            "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)",
            "\u2018I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve seen that done,\u2019 thought Alice. \u2018I\u2019ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \u201cThere was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,\u201d and I never understood what it meant till now.\u2019",
            "\u2018If that\u2019s all you know about it, you may stand down,\u2019 continued the King.",

            "\u2018I\u2019d rather finish my tea,\u2019 said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.",

            "\u2018--and just take his head off outside,\u2019 the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.",

            "The next witness was the Duchess\u2019s cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.",

            "Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, \u2018--for they haven\u2019t got much evidence YET,\u2019 she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \u2018Alice!\u2019"

            "\u2018Here!\u2019 cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.",
            "\u2018Oh, I BEG your pardon!\u2019 she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.",
            "\u2018The trial cannot proceed,\u2019 said the King in a very grave voice, \u2018until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,\u2019 he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.",
            "Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; \u2018not that it signifies much,\u2019 she said to herself; \u2018I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.\u2019",
            "As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.",
            "\u2018What do you know about this business?\u2019 the King said to Alice.",
            "\u2018Nothing,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Nothing WHATEVER?\u2019 persisted the King.",
            "\u2018Nothing whatever,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018That\u2019s very important,\u2019 the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: \u2018UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,\u2019 he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.",
            "\u2018UNimportant, of course, I meant,\u2019 the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,",
            "\u2018important--unimportant--unimportant--important--\u2019 as if he were trying which word sounded best.",
            "Some of the jury wrote it down \u2018important,\u2019 and some \u2018unimportant.\u2019 Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; \u2018but it doesn\u2019t matter a bit,\u2019 she thought to herself.",
            "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out \u2018Silence!\u2019 and read out from his book, \u2018Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.\u2019",
            "Everybody looked at Alice.",
            "\u2018I\u2019M not a mile high,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018You are,\u2019 said the King.",
            "\u2018Nearly two miles high,\u2019 added the Queen.",
            "\u2018Well, I shan\u2019t go, at any rate,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018besides, that\u2019s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.\u2019",
            "\u2018It\u2019s the oldest rule in the book,\u2019 said the King.",
            "\u2018Then it ought to be Number One,\u2019 said Alice.",
            "The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \u2018Consider your verdict,\u2019 he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.",
            "\u2018There\u2019s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\u2019 said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \u2018this paper has just been picked up.\u2019",
            "\u2018What\u2019s in it?\u2019 said the Queen.",
            "\u2018I haven\u2019t opened it yet,\u2019 said the White Rabbit, \u2018but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.\u2019",
            "\u2018It must have been that,\u2019 said the King, \u2018unless it was written to nobody, which isn\u2019t usual, you know.\u2019",
            "\u2018Who is it directed to?\u2019 said one of the jurymen.",
            "\u2018It isn\u2019t directed at all,\u2019 said the White Rabbit; \u2018in fact, there\u2019s nothing written on the OUTSIDE.\u2019 He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added \u2018It isn\u2019t a letter, after all: it\u2019s a set of verses.\u2019",
            "\u2018Are they in the prisoner\u2019s handwriting?\u2019 asked another of the jurymen.",
            "\u2018No, they\u2019re not,\u2019 said the White Rabbit, \u2018and that\u2019s the queerest thing about it.\u2019 (The jury all looked puzzled.)",
            "\u2018He must have imitated somebody else\u2019s hand,\u2019 said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)",
            "\u2018Please your Majesty,\u2019 said the Knave, \u2018I didn\u2019t write it, and they can\u2019t prove I did: there\u2019s no name signed at the end.\u2019",
            "\u2018If you didn\u2019t sign it,\u2019 said the King, \u2018that only makes the matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you\u2019d have signed your name like an honest man.\u2019",
            "There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.",
            "\u2018That PROVES his guilt,\u2019 said the Queen.",
            "\u2018It proves nothing of the sort!\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Why, you don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re about!\u2019",
            "\u2018Read them,\u2019 said the King.",
            "The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \u2018Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?\u2019 he asked.",
            "\u2018Begin at the beginning,\u2019 the King said gravely, \u2018and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\u2019",

            "\u2018They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim.",
            "He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would become of you?",
            "I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before.",
            "If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were.",
            "My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it.",
            "Don\u2019t let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.\u2019",
            "\u2018That\u2019s the most important piece of evidence we\u2019ve heard yet,\u2019 said the King, rubbing his hands; \u2018so now let the jury--\u2019",
            "\u2018If any one of them can explain it,\u2019 said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn\u2019t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) \u2018I\u2019ll give him sixpence. _I_ don\u2019t believe there\u2019s an atom of meaning in it.\u2019",
            "The jury all wrote down on their slates, \u2018SHE doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s an atom of meaning in it,\u2019 but none of them attempted to explain the paper.",
            "\u2018If there\u2019s no meaning in it,\u2019 said the King, \u2018that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn\u2019t try to find any. And yet I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; \u2018I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \u201c--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--\u201d you can\u2019t swim, can you?\u2019 he added, turning to the Knave.",
            "The Knave shook his head sadly. \u2018Do I look like it?\u2019 he said. (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)",
            "\u2018All right, so far,\u2019 said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: \u2018\u201cWE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\u201d that\u2019s the jury, of course--\u201cI GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\u201d why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--\u2019",
            "\u2018But, it goes on \u201cTHEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\u201d\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Why, there they are!\u2019 said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. \u2018Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--\u201cBEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--\u201d you never had fits, my dear, I think?\u2019 he said to the Queen.",
            "\u2018Never!\u2019 said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)",
            "\u2018Then the words don\u2019t FIT you,\u2019 said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.",
            "\u2018It\u2019s a pun!\u2019 the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, \u2018Let the jury consider their verdict,\u2019 the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.",
            "\u2018No, no!\u2019 said the Queen. \u2018Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\u2019",
            "\u2018Stuff and nonsense!\u2019 said Alice loudly. \u2018The idea of having the sentence first!\u2019",
            "\u2018Hold your tongue!\u2019 said the Queen, turning purple.",
            "\u2018I won\u2019t!\u2019 said Alice.",
            "\u2018Off with her head!\u2019 the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.",
            "\u2018Who cares for you?\u2019 said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) \u2018You\u2019re nothing but a pack of cards!\u2019",
            "At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.",
            "\u2018Wake up, Alice dear!\u2019 said her sister; \u2018Why, what a long sleep you\u2019ve had!\u2019",
            "\u2018Oh, I\u2019ve had such a curious dream!\u2019 said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \u2018It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\u2019s getting late.\u2019 So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.",
            "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--",
            "First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream.",
            "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess\u2019s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard\u2019s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.",
            "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\u2019s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle\u2019s heavy sobs.",
            "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days."
